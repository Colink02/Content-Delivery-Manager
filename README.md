# content-delivery-manager

# Project Goal
  The goal of this project is to make a webpage based file manager similar to 
  Google Drive but Open Source and allows you to extend and support other file
  formats as well as adding a bunch of really useful features.

## Special features
  Additional features I plan to add are
1. Handling of unique urls for sharing and analytics
2. Implementation of a git like system for files to handle changes and activity
3. Support for most used formats
   1. Text files (.txt, .rtf, .md, etc.)
   2. Photo formats (.png, .webp, .bmp, .jpeg, etc.)
   3. Video formats (.avi, .mp4, etc.)
   4. Audio formats (.mp3, .m4a, etc.)
4. Support to convert formats within right click menu (advanced settings for ffmpeg?)
5.
